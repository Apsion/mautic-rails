# Mautic rails 
RoR helper / wrapper for Mautic API and forms

## Usage
* Gem provides API connection to your Mautic(s)
  1. Create mautic connection
  2. Authorize it
  3. 
  ```ruby
  m = Mautic::MauticConnection.last
  m.connection.get("api/contacts") # => return contacts from your mautic
  ```
* Gem provides simple Mautic form submit.
There are two options of usage:
  1. Use default mautic url from configuration and shortcut class method:
    ```ruby
    # form: ID of form in Mautic *required*
    # url: Mautic URL - default is from configuration
    # request: request object (for domain, and forward IP...) *optional*
    Mautic::FormHelper.submit(form: "mautic form ID") do |i|
      i.form_field1 = "value1"
      i.form_field2 = "value2"
    end
    ``` 
  2. Or create instance
  ```ruby
  # request is *optional*
  m = Mautic::FormHelper.new("https://mymautic.com", request)
  m.data = {} # hash of attributes
  m.push # push data to mautic 
  ```

## Installation
